.SH DESCRIPTION
indiestor is an Open Source storage platform for Avid collboration. Management is performed using a free command line tool. This takes care of both users and groups, as well as the sharing of projects and media. A none-free Graphical User Interface is avaible from our site for a small fee.

The system using incron and inotify to watch the file system for 'share triggers' (see below). There is very little for the editor to learn and nothing to install on each workstation.

Be aware that indiestor does not attempt to emulate AECIFS or Avid style bin locking. Instead it is a home centric storage solution where each editor is provided with their own network drive.

.B OS COMPATIBILITY:
Debian Wheezy (Recommended),
Debian Squeeze,
Ubuntu Precise,
Ubuntu Raring

.B SHARING PROJECTS:
To share a project the leading editor must: a) be in a group with his/her co-editors b) name a new or existing project with the with appropriate 'share trigger'.

For avid shared projects use:
.B
 <projectname>.avid

For folders containing AMA volumes, legacy style FCP projects or anything else use:
.B
 <foldername>.shared

.B NB:
indiestor only listens to share triggers on the top level each user home. 

Upon the detection of each
.B .avid
trigger indiestor automatically creates and distributes 
.B .copy
versions of the project. The .copy projects can be found in each group memebers “Avid Shared Projects” folder.

Inside each node of the shared project you will find the 'sharing tree'. The sharing tree is a network of folders that allows bins to be offered read-only to the group. An Unprotected folder is provided for conveniently exchanging bins between editors.

.B SHARING MXF MEDIA:
Media sharing is enabled automatically as soon as media exists in /<user>/Avid MediaFiles/MXF. As an aside, it is quite possible to use indiestor as a cheap way to expand the media storage capacity of an exsiting network.

.B ONE GROUP LIMITATION:
At present users can only be a member of one group at a time. However, we aim to raise enough funding through sales of our GUI to implement multiple group membership and extended ZFS features.

Our feature roadmap is available here: http://indiestor.com/indiestor-roadmap-2014-2015

.B UNSHARING:
The leading editor (.avid owner) can unshare at any time by simply removing the share trigger. For example, by renaming the project folder “episode3.avid" to “episode”3 indiestor will automatically unshare the project. As part of this process work completed by each editor in /shared/<user> will be archived into the lead project.

.SH OPTIONS
There are six main entities through which the command line operates:

.B --groups, --group, --users, --user, --services --help

.IP --groups

.B -show:
Shows the list of indiestor groups. Not all groups listed in
.B /etc/group
are indiestor groups. 

.B -start-watching:
Starts indiestor-inotify watching for share triggers

.B -stop-watching:
Stops indiestor-inotify watching for share triggers

.IP --groups

.B -show -json:
JSON export of the group list (for easy plugin to GUI applications)

.IP --group <arg>
 
The
.B <arg>
argument must be an indiestor group.

.B -add:
creates a new indiestor group.

.B -delete:
deletes the named indiestor group.

.B -show-members:
shows the users in the named indiestor group.

.B -start-watching:
Starts indiestor-inotify watching for share triggers assigned to a specified group

.B -stop-watching:
Stops indiestor-inotify watching for share triggers assigned to a specified group

.B -show-watch-processes:
Displays the 2 watch processes for the specified group.

.IP --group <arg>

.B -show-watches <arg>
Displays the watch table for the arguments 'main' and 'avp'. All watches are main type unless a user attempts to trigger .avid sharing without a valid avp project file. In this case we use an 'avp' watch to monitor the situation. The project will only trigger when the .avp is appropriately named and has physical KB size.

.IP --users

.B -show:
shows the list of indiestor users.

.B COLUMNS

.B 	user: 
username

.B 	home: 
home directory for the user

.B 	locked: 
Y=yes, N=no

.B 	group: 
indiestor group for the user*

.B 	ZFS quota: 
ZFS quota in gigabytes

.B 	used: 
gigabytes used

.B 	%used:
percentage used

.B 	samba: 
Y=has samba access, N=does not have samba access

.B 	flags: 
samba flags. Normally U=user.

.B 	SMB conn.: 
Currently connected through samba.

* "-" if the user does not belong to an indiestor group.

.B  -regenerate-incrontab:
for debugging purposes. If the incrontab seems inconsistent, you can forcably regenerate it.

.B  -reshare:
reshares all triggers and updates share permission, should you need to prompt the system.

.IP --users

.B -show -json:
JSON export of the users list (for easy plugin to GUI applications)

.IP --user
.B <arg>

The
.B <arg>
argument must be an indiestor username.

.B -add: 
adds the user named to indiestor. If the user account does not exist, indiestor will create it. If the user exists, but is not an indiestor user, indiestor will add the user to the "indiestor-users" group. By default, indiestor also adds the user to Samba.

.B -delete:
removes the user named from indiestor.

.B -set-home <arg>:
sets the home directory for the user named to <arg>.

.B -remove-home:
only used in conjuction with the -delete action. In addition to deleting the user account, this option also deletes the user's home folder.

.B -set-group <arg>:
sets the group for the user named to the indiestor group <arg>. This indiestor group must exist already.

.B -unset-group:
removes the user named from his/her current indiestor group.

.B -set-zfs-quota  <arg>:
sets the zfs quota for the user named to <arg> gigabytes (if the home is ZFS based). Must be a valid number of gigabytes.

.B -remove-zfs-quota:
removes the ZFS quota for the user and makes his quota unlimited.

.B -set-passwd <arg>:
sets the user's password to <arg>.

.B -lock:
locks the account for the user named. This prevents the user from logging in or connecting through samba. The samba flags will contain the "D" flag. The system locks the user by writing "!" in front of the password field of the user's record in the file
.B /etc/shadow
.You can unlock the account by setting the password again with the -set-passwd <arg> action.

.B -add-to-samba:
Adds an existing user to samba. 

.IP --user <arg>:
.B -remove-from-indiestor:
Removes the user <arg> from indiestor. This action cannot be combined with other actions.

.IP --user <arg>:
.B -remove-from-samba:
Removes the user <arg> from samba. This action cannot be combined with other actions.

.IP --user <arg>:
.B -reshare:
reshares all project folders and media manually (for the specified user).

.IP --services <arg>:
.B -start-watching:
Starts indiestor watches (same as groups -start-watching)

.B -stop-watching:
Stops indiestor watches (same as groups -start-watching)

.B -start-samba:
Starts samba server

.B -stop-watching:
Stops samba server

.B -start-netatalk:
Starts netatalk server

.B -stop-netatalk:
Stops netatalk server

.B -start-incron:

.IP --services

.B -show -json:
JSON export of the servcice list (for easy plugin to GUI applications)

.IP --help:
Shows the command the synopsis.


.SH EXAMPLES
It is possible to combine multiple actions for the same entity.

For example:

.B indiestor --user john -add -set-group grp1 -passwd hello

The command above adds “john” to the system, makes him a memeber of the group "grp1" and sets his password to "hello". By default, the system will create john's home folder in
.B /home/john
. You can override this default by using the -set-home <arg> option. If the target volume is a ZFS storage pool indiestor will create an individual ZFS dataset for the user. For now we only recommend using ZFS storage with windows clients.

.SH FILES
.I /etc/passwd
.RS
This is where the system stores the user records. There is a special user, which monitors the filesystem through incron.
.RE
.I /etc/group
.RS
This is where the system stores the group records. All indiestor users are registered in the indiestor-users group.
For example, all users for indiestor group "grp1" are registered in the "is_grp1" group. The "is_" prefix stands for "indiestor". special group: The indiewheel group lists the users that are allowed to execute the indiestor command besides the root user.
.RE
.I /etc/incron.allow
.RS
Must list the indienotify user. The indienotify user is the user for which incron watches the filesystem.
.RE
.I /var/spool/incron/indienotify
.RS
The incron table for the indienotify system user. The indiestor and indiestor-inotify commands regenerate this table as needed as a consequence of admin actions or as a consequence of changes in the filesystem monitored. In case of issues, use the --users -regenerate-incrontab option to regenerate this file. You can show the content of the file with the option --users -show-incrontab.
.RE
.I /etc/init.d/indiestor-watch
.RS
This init.d script starts/stops all watches. It is deployed on installation and positioned to initialise when the system boots.
.RE
.I /etc/super.tab
.RS
This file must have an entry for the indiestor and indiestor-inotify command ensuring that the indiewheel group can operate the indiestor command as root and the indienotify user to operate the indiestor-inotify command as root.
.RE
.I /etc/netatalk/Applevolumes.default
.RS
Netatalk home shares for Mac clients.
.RE
.I /etc/samba/smb.conf
.RS
Netatalk home shares for Windows clients.
.RE
.I /etc/samba/smb.conf
.RS
Must list indiestor shares.
.RE
.I /var/lib/samba
.RS
Indiestor automatically keeps the users and passwords for the indiestor-users group in sync with samba's users and passwords.
.RE
.I /var/log/syslog:
.RS
indiestor-inotify logs its operations to this file, which is the system log file. You can inspect it with the command:
.RE
.I /etc/shadow
.RS
The system stores the user passwords in this file.

.SH MISCELLANEOUS NOTES

.B Connecting Mac clients to indiestor:
Users should switch to Finder and use Command + K or click Go > connect to server:

afp://<IP-ADDRESS-or-HOST-NAME>/

Mac users will periodically see the “project settings not saved due to an error”. While this can be annoying, it is largely cosemtic and only effects the .avp file. It does not effect .avb or .avs files. We recommend AFP over samba for Mac clients because of its superior performance. Users that wish to use Samba on Mac will need the Thursby Dave samba client. To enable samba for Mac you will need to uncomment the “indiestor-mac” share in /etc/samba/smb.conf.

.B Connecting Windows clients to indiestor:
Right click on "Computer" then choose "Map Network Drive".

All users in a group should agree to map mounts to the same drive letter using the following folder path:

\e\e<IP-ADDRESS-or-HOST-NAME>\eindiestor-win

The 'Connect using different credentials' is handy if windows signs you in automatically.

NB: Windows users must to disable UAC.

.B Enable Avid "All Drives":
this option must be enabled as it allows Avid to use third party network shares. You can enable it by going into the Avid "Tools" menu, choosing the "Console" option then and typing "alldrives 1".

Hit enter and the console should respond with:
 "All drives will be viewed as media drives"

.B FURTHER DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION:
Further diagnostic information can be found on our Technical FAQs page at: http://www.indiestor.com/documentation/getting-started/admin-faq

.B SUPPORT:
Please direct indiestor native support requests to our google community at:
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/indiestor

.B Indiestor GUI:
You can purchase an elegant graphical user interface for managing indiestor native from our website. This is available for a small fee, which will help fund the further development of this project. GUI includes one year limited email support. Additional years support can be purchased as required.
